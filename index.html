            Johannesburg, South Africa's biggest city and capital of Gauteng province,
                 began as a 19th-century gold-mining settlement.
                  Its sprawling Soweto township was once home to Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu.
                   Mandelaâ€™s former residence is now the Mandela House museum. 
                   Other Soweto museums that recount the struggle to end segregation include the somber Apartheid Museum and Constitution Hill,
                    a former prison complex.</p>
